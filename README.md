This Turing article covers the importance of building a portfolio for applying to software engineering jobs that can demonstrate your qualifications for your desired job. It explains how a portfolio can make a candidate stand out from an applicant pool by showing a wide range of abilities, unique traits, and continuous learning. Some of their tips for new Software Engineers are to build small projects that show a thorough understanding of important concepts as they expand their knowledge, seek collaboration and feedback from other developers online, and document their journey on social media to create credibility and visibility.

I think this article is really interesting because I didn't realized how crucial it was to build a portfolio when I was applying to internships, and I'm sure I would've had much more success with landing one if I was able to demonstrate my past experience and skills with tangible evidence. - Shubhi
